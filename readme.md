Welcome to *Ylva!*

**Not** UCI compliant. 

Run using `run.sh`. This brings up a menu, with options to play with a friend, with the engine, engine v engine, or run Perft.

Currently, everything runs in the terminal. 

Current move generation speed is `~500k` nodes/second. Proper benchmarking to be done in the future.
